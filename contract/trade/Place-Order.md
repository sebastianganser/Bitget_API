# Place Order

* Rate limit: 10 requests/second/UID
* Rate limit: 1 request/second/UID for **copy trading traders**

### Description[​](#description "Direct link to Description")

* Ignore the `tradeSide` parameter when position mode is in `one-way-mode`
* In “hedge-mode”, when there is limit close order occupying the position, if the size of next market close order and limit close orders exceeds the position size, it will return an “insufficient position error” instead of cancelling the current limit order and executing the market order
* **hedge position mode**: **Open long**: "side"=`buy`, "tradeSide"=`open`; **Close long**: "side"=`buy`, "tradeSide"=`close`; **Open short**: "side"=`sell`, "tradeSide"=`open`; **Close short**: "side"=`sell`, "tradeSide"=`close`; **one-way position mode**: "side"=`buy` and `sell`, tradeSide: ignore
* In `one-way-mode` position mode, if the total size of the new reduce-only order and the existing reduce-only orders exceeds the position size, the system will cancel the existing reduce-only orders sequentially based on their creation order until the total size of the new and existing reduce-only orders is less than or equal to the position size. Additionally, the response for the latest reduce-only order request will not include an `orderId`. You can use the `clientOid` set in the request to query order details or retrieve the orderId from the current pending orders.
* When in `hedge Mode`, if a limit close order is occupying a position, and a subsequent market close order (its quantity plus the limit order's quantity) exceeds the total position size, it will not report an insufficient position error. It also won't cancel the limit order that's occupying the position. Instead, the quantity of the limit close order will be preserved, and the market order will close only the quantity remaining after subtracting the limit order's quantity from the total position size. For example: If you have a position of 100, a limit order occupies 70, and you then place a market close order for 50, it will not report an insufficient position error, nor will it cancel the occupying limit order to execute the market order. Instead, it will directly close a quantity of 30.
* When in `hedge Mode`,if the existing quantity is equal to the limit close position order of the held position, a newly added close position order will automatically cancel the limit order that has occupied the position.
