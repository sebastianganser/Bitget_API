### Description[​](#description "Direct link to Description")

Interface for order modification, used to modify an pending order, such as its TP/SL and/or price/size.

* Modifying size and price will cancel the old order; then create a **new order** asynchronously, modify the preset TPSL will not cancel the old order.
* Modifying size and price, please pass in both, not just one of them
* Modify the order price, size and preset TPSL according to orderId or clientOId
* It is only allowed to modify the new status limit order. If the size, price and TPSL all is set in the request, then the TPSL will not work
* Modify the limit order price and size, please be sure to provide newClientOid, because the orderId of the new order cannot be returned synchronously, so you need to use newClientOid to help you query order information
* Modifying the order size needs to meet the minimum order quantity
* If you only modify the TPSL, please do not pass price and size. If you only pass one of TP or SL, the other one will be cancelled
