# Change Leverage

Frequency limit: 5 times/1s (uid)

### Description[​](#description "Direct link to Description")

Adjust the leverage on the given symbol and productType

Note: When adjusting leverage in cross margin mode, please use the leverage parameter instead of `longLeverage` or `shortLeverage`. Currently, there is no mandatory validation for `longLeverage` and `shortLeverage`. If these two parameters are passed in cross margin mode, they will still take effect, with `longLeverage` taking priority.
