This document is intended to clarify the API usage for ND-brokers(non-disclosed broker) . If you have certain R&D and operation capabilities, and want to build a trading platform and manage your user independently, the independent broker service Yes is the best choice. You are responsible for front-end development and user operations, while Bitget provides you with back-end technology and market liquidity to empower your transaction value-added services.
