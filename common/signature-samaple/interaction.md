### Timestamp[​](#timestamp "Direct link to Timestamp")

The unit of ACCESS-TIMESTAMP in the HTTP request signature is milliseconds. The timestamp of the request must be within 30 seconds of the API server time, otherwise the request will be considered expired and rejected.
If there is a large deviation between the local server time and the API server time, we recommend that you compare the timestamp by querying the [API server time](/api-doc/spot/public/Get-Server-Time).

### Frequency Limiting Rules[​](#frequency-limiting-rules "Direct link to Frequency Limiting Rules")

If the request is too frequent, the system will automatically limit the request and return the 429 too many requests status code.

* Public interface：For the [market](/api-doc/category/market-2) information interfaces, the unified rate limit is a maximum of 20 requests per second.
* Authorization interface：apikey is used to restrict the calling of authorization interfaces, refer to the frequency restriction rules of each interface for frequency restriction.

* GET: The parameters are transmitted to the server in the path through queryString.
