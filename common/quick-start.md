# Quick Start

## Access Preparation[​](#access-preparation "Direct link to Access Preparation")

If you need to use the API, please log in to the [web page](javascript:;), then apply the API key application and complete the permission configuration, and then develop and trade according to the details of this document.

You can click [API Key Management](javascript:;)  to create an API Key after login.

Each UID can create 10 Api Keys, and each Api Key can set permissions as read only or read/write.

The permissions are described as follows:

* Read-Only permission: Read permission authorized to query data, such as market data.
* Trade permission: Transaction permission authorized to call the interface of placing and cancelling orders.
* Transfer permission: With this permission it authorized to transfer coins between accounts.
* Withdraw permission: Authorized to withdraw assets from Bitget account, `noted that you can only withdraw coins through an whitelisted IP address.`

After successfully created the API key, please remember the following information:

* `APIKey` The identity of API transactions, generated by a random algorithm.
* `SecretKey` The private key is randomly generated by the system and used for [Signature](/api-doc/common/signature) generation.
* `Passphrase` The password is set by the user. It should be noted that if you forgot the Passphrase, it cannot be retrieved back, and the APIKey needs to be recreated.

For security reasons, it is strongly recommended that you bind to an IP address when you create the API key

**Risk Warning**：These three keys are highly related to account security. Please keep in mind DO NOT DISCLOSE **Secretkey and Passphrase** to anyone at any circumstances, even with BitGet employees. Leaking any one of these three keys may cause the loss of your assets. If you find by any chance that the APIKey is compromized, please delete the APIKey as soon as possible.

## Interface Type[​](#interface-type "Direct link to Interface Type")

Interfaces are mainly divided into two types:

* Public Interface
* Private Interface

**Public Interface**

The public interface can be used to obtain configuration information and market data. Public requests can be used without authentication.

**Private Interface**

The private interface can be used for order management and account management. Every private request must be [Signed](/api-doc/common/signature).

The private interface will be verified from server side with your API Key info.

## Access Restriction[​](#access-restriction "Direct link to Access Restriction")

This chapter mainly focuses on access restrictions:

* Rest API will return 429 status when the access exceeds the frequency limit: the request is too frequent.

**Rest API**

The rate limit of interfaces is based on UID or IP. You can get detailed information from the separated API document page.

Frequency limit rules:

1. The rate limit of each API endpoint is marked on the doc page;
2. The rate limit of each API interface is calculated independently;
3. The overall rate limit is 6000/IP/Min
